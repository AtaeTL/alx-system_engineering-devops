Summary of Incident:
On Tuesday, May 19, 2020, InnovateCommerce experienced a system outage that severely impacted its operations. As a result, employees were unable to perform their tasks efficiently, leading to unprocessed requests, disrupted distribution, a significant drop in daily sales, and dissatisfied customers due to delayed product deliveries.

Incident Timeline:
At 8:00 AM, employees began their daily tasks and noticed that they couldn't access the crucial software used for managing various aspects of the company, such as accounting, billing, distribution, and inventory.

The company's system department was promptly notified.

A technical support specialist investigated the main server cabinet and found the server to be powered off.

The technical support specialist resolved the issue by 5:30 PM, restoring server functionality.

Root Cause:
The server outage was caused by a failure in the power supply.

Resolution and Recovery:
Around 8:00 AM, the technical support specialist discovered the server was powered off. They checked the power connections and cables, all of which were in order.

Since the server was a rack-mounted unit, it was removed from the cabinet for inspection. A significant amount of dust was found inside, with the fans exhibiting reduced mobility.

After thorough inspection and cleaning, the technician diagnosed a malfunctioning power supply by around 10:00 AM.

The company sourced replacement power supplies from a wholesale distributor, and two units were purchased to expedite the repair process.

During the wait for the replacement parts, the server was meticulously cleaned, internal connections were checked, and the cabinet was cleaned as well.

At 4:40 PM, the replacement power supplies arrived and were promptly installed. The server's functionality was verified, and it was reinstalled into the cabinet.

Corrective and Preventive Measures:

An additional power source was installed for the server to ensure redundancy.
An external backup of all server data was created as a precaution.
A second internal storage disk was requested to implement a RAID configuration for data redundancy.
A UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) was acquired to safeguard the server against power interruptions.
A periodic maintenance schedule was established for both the server and other infrastructure systems.
Plans were made to transition services to cloud-based platforms, with necessary authorization and budget allocation.
By implementing these measures, InnovateCommerce aims to enhance the stability, security, and resilience of its systems and operations.
